MoneyMate is a finance app for tracking student spending and income, with a dosage of AI. When students decide to get jobs, and pay for their own expenses, MoneyMate allows them to visually see, remove, and report transactions over a period of time. As a regular financial app, it can filter, search, and generate summaries. Although it dosen't connect to real bank accounts, further updates are expected.
